# Arduino Health Monitoring Dashboard
## Project Summary

### What We Built

We developed a **real-time health monitoring system** that uses Arduino sensors to collect physiological data (heart rate and skin temperature) and provides personalized heatstroke risk assessments through a web-based dashboard. The system combines hardware, signal processing, machine learning, and web development to create a comprehensive healthcare monitoring solution.

### Key Innovation

**Real-time physiological data integration for personalized health risk assessment.** Unlike traditional health apps that rely on manual input, our system automatically analyzes actual sensor data to provide accurate, personalized health insights.

### Technical Achievements

#### 1. Advanced Signal Processing
- **PPG Signal Analysis**: Extracted heart rate from noisy infrared signals using bandpass filtering and FFT
- **Real-time Processing**: <100ms latency for live data analysis
- **Confidence Scoring**: Reliability metrics for all measurements

#### 2. Machine Learning Integration
- **Personalized Risk Assessment**: Random Forest model combining sensor data with user demographics
- **Real-time Predictions**: Dynamic risk updates as new data arrives
- **Multi-risk Detection**: Heatstroke, infection, dehydration, and arrhythmia risk scoring

#### 3. Full-Stack Web Application
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Live data visualization with WebSocket communication
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **User-friendly Interface**: Color-coded risk levels with actionable recommendations

#### 4. Hardware Integration
- **Arduino Sensor Interface**: PPG and temperature sensor integration
- **Data Pipeline**: Seamless flow from hardware to web interface
- **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to add new sensors and features

### Impact & Applications
