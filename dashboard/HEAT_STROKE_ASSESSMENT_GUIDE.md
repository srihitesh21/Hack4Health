3. **Fill out the form**: Complete all relevant sections
4. **Submit assessment**: Click "Assess Heat Stroke Risk"
5. **Review results**: Examine risk level, recommendations, and critical factors

## Assessment Categories

### 1. Core Temperature Assessment

**Critical Input**: Core body temperature is the most important indicator of heat stroke.

- **Measurement Method**: 
  - **Rectal** (Most Accurate): Gold standard for heat stroke assessment
  - **Oral**: Less reliable during heat-related illness
  - **Ear/Forehead/Temporal**: Not recommended for heat stroke diagnosis

- **Temperature Thresholds**:
  - **≥104°F (40°C)**: Critical - immediate medical attention required
  - **102-103.9°F**: High risk - monitor closely
  - **100-101.9°F**: Moderate risk - take precautions
  - **<100°F**: Normal range

### 2. Mental Status Evaluation

**Critical Input**: Central nervous system dysfunction distinguishes heat stroke from heat exhaustion.

**Assessment Options**:
- **Normal**: Alert and oriented
- **Confused**: Disoriented to person, place, or time
- **Agitated**: Restless, irritable behavior
- **Delirious**: Severe confusion with hallucinations
- **Unconscious**: Unresponsive to stimuli
- **Seizure**: Convulsive activity

- **Drowsy/Lethargic**: Excessive sleepiness or fatigue

### 3. Vital Signs Monitoring

**Heart Rate (BPM)**:
- **≥120**: High risk (tachycardia)
- **100-119**: Moderate risk
- **60-99**: Normal range
- **<60**: May indicate other conditions

**Respiratory Rate (per minute)**:
- **≥25**: High risk (tachypnea)
- **20-24**: Moderate risk
- **12-19**: Normal range
- **<12**: May indicate other conditions

**Blood Pressure**: Document for baseline comparison

### 4. Environmental Factors

**Environmental Temperature**:
- **≥95°F**: High risk environment
- **85-94°F**: Moderate risk
- **75-84°F**: Low risk
- **<75°F**: Minimal risk

**Humidity**:
- **≥80%**: High risk (reduces evaporative cooling)
- **60-79%**: Moderate risk
- **<60%**: Lower risk

**Activity Level**:
- **Extreme Exercise**: Highest risk
- **Strenuous Exercise**: High risk
- **Moderate Exercise**: Moderate risk
- **Light Activity**: Low risk
- **Resting**: Minimal risk

### 5. Symptoms Assessment

**High-Risk Symptoms** (select all that apply):
- **Headache**: Common in heat-related illness
- **Dizziness**: Indicates cardiovascular stress
- **Nausea/Vomiting**: Gastrointestinal involvement
- **Muscle Cramps**: Electrolyte imbalance
- **Weakness/Fatigue**: Systemic involvement
- **Hot Skin**: Elevated body temperature
- **Dry Skin**: Dehydration indicator
- **Rapid Breathing**: Respiratory compensation

### 6. Medical History & Risk Factors

**Age Risk Factors**:
- **<5 years**: High risk (immature thermoregulation)
- **≥65 years**: High risk (decreased thermoregulatory capacity)
- **18-64 years**: Standard risk assessment

**Medical Conditions** (select all that apply):
- **Heart Disease**: Compromised cardiovascular function
- **Diabetes**: Altered thermoregulation
- **Respiratory Conditions**: Compromised breathing
- **Mental Illness**: May affect self-care
- **Obesity**: Increased heat production
- **Chronic Dehydration**: Baseline fluid deficit

**Hydration Status**:
- **Well Hydrated**: Normal fluid balance
- **Mildly Dehydrated**: Slight fluid deficit
- **Dehydrated**: Significant fluid deficit
- **Severely Dehydrated**: Critical fluid deficit

## Risk Assessment Algorithm

The system uses a weighted scoring algorithm based on medical evidence:

### Critical Factors (Immediate Action Required)
- **Core Temperature ≥104°F**: 30 points
- **Altered Mental Status**: 25 points
- **Multiple Critical Factors**: Emergency action required

### High-Risk Factors
- **Heart Rate ≥120 BPM**: 15 points
- **Respiratory Rate ≥25/min**: 10 points
- **Environmental Temp ≥95°F**: 15 points
- **Humidity ≥80%**: 10 points
- **Age Risk Factors**: 10 points
- **Medical Conditions**: 5 points each
- **Symptoms**: 5 points each
- **Dehydration**: 10-15 points

### Risk Level Classification
- **CRITICAL (≥80 points)**: 90% probability of heat stroke
- **HIGH (60-79 points)**: 70% probability
- **MODERATE (40-59 points)**: 40% probability
- **LOW (20-39 points)**: 20% probability
- **MINIMAL (<20 points)**: 5% probability

## Recommendations by Risk Level

### CRITICAL RISK
🚨 **EMERGENCY ACTIONS REQUIRED**:
1. Call 911 immediately
2. Initiate immediate cooling measures
3. Move to cool environment
4. Remove excess clothing
5. Apply ice packs to neck, armpits, and groin
6. Monitor vital signs continuously

### HIGH RISK
⚠️ **IMMEDIATE ATTENTION NEEDED**:
1. Seek immediate medical attention
2. Move to air-conditioned environment
3. Apply cool compresses
4. Drink cool fluids if conscious
5. Monitor for worsening symptoms

### MODERATE RISK
📋 **PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES**:

- **Activity Level**: Estimated from activity sensor

## Assessment History & Trends

The system maintains assessment history to track:
- **Risk progression**: Increasing/decreasing risk over time
- **Response to interventions**: Effectiveness of cooling measures
- **Pattern recognition**: Identify risk factors and triggers
- **Documentation**: Medical record keeping

4. **Monitor trends** over time
5. **Follow evidence-based protocols**

### For First Responders
1. **Prioritize temperature and mental status**
2. **Initiate cooling immediately** for critical cases
3. **Transport to medical facility** for high-risk cases
4. **Document environmental conditions**
5. **Monitor for deterioration**

### For Individuals
1. **Know your risk factors**
2. **Monitor symptoms** in hot environments
