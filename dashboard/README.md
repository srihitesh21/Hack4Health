# Arduino Dashboard with Heart Rate Monitoring

A real-time web dashboard for monitoring Arduino sensor data with heart rate analysis from PPG signals.

## Features

- **Real-time Sensor Monitoring**: Temperature, humidity, light, pressure, and PPG signals
- **Heart Rate Analysis**: PPG signal processing with spectrogram visualization
- **CSV Analysis**: Automatic analysis of PPG data from CSV files
- **Responsive Design**: Modern UI with Bootstrap and custom styling
- **WebSocket Communication**: Real-time data updates

## Data Formats

The dashboard supports multiple data formats from Arduino:

### JSON Format (Recommended)
```json
{
  "temperature": 25.5,
  "humidity": 60.2,
  "light": 512,
  "pressure": 1013.25,
  "ppg": 258
}
```

### CSV Format
```
25.5,60.2,512,1013.25,258
```

### Key-Value Format
```
temp:25.5,humidity:60.2,light:512,pressure:1013.25,ppg:258
```

## Installation

1. **Install Python Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Dashboard**:
   ```bash
   ./start_dashboard.sh
   ```
   Or manually:
   ```bash
   python3 arduino_dashboard.py
   ```

3. **Open in Browser**:
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5002`

## Arduino Setup

### Basic Setup
1. Connect your Arduino to your computer
2. Upload the example sketch (`arduino_example.ino`)
3. Open the dashboard and click "Connect Arduino"

## Dashboard Features

### Real-time Cards
- **Temperature**: Current temperature in Â°C
- **Humidity**: Current humidity percentage
- **Light**: Light sensor reading
- **Pressure**: Atmospheric pressure in hPa
- **Heart Rate**: Real-time BPM from PPG analysis
- **PPG Signal**: Raw PPG sensor value

### Heart Rate Analysis
- PPG signal processing with bandpass filtering
- Spectrogram generation for frequency analysis
- Confidence scoring for heart rate estimates
- Automatic CSV file analysis from BPM directory

### Data Logging
- Real-time data log with timestamps
- Sensor values and heart rate data
- Automatic log rotation (keeps last 50 entries)

## New Features: Physiological Data Integration (2025)

### Heatstroke Risk Assessment with Real Sensor Data
- The dashboard now uses **real-time BPM (heart rate)** and **skin temperature** from Arduino sensor CSVs (analyzed via `BPM/newA.py`) to improve the accuracy of heatstroke risk prediction.
- The **Heatstroke Risk Assessment** card on the demographics page displays:
  - Risk Level (Low/Moderate/High)
  - Probability (%)
  - **Current BPM** (with confidence score)
  - **Skin Temperature** (with min-max range)
  - Personalized recommendations
- These values are automatically extracted from the latest sensor data and used as features in the machine learning model for heatstroke prediction.

### Live Physiological Data Card
- Even if no heatstroke prediction is available, a separate card displays the latest BPM and skin temperature range from your Arduino sensors.
- This card updates in real time and provides transparency into the physiological data being used for risk assessment.

#### Example Display
```
ðŸ“Š Current Physiological Data
Current BPM: 84.8 BPM (Confidence: 21.7%)
Skin Temperature: 34.6Â°C (Range: 23.7-42.1Â°C)
Data Source: Sensor Data
```

### How it Works
- When you submit a health assessment, the backend analyzes the latest Arduino CSV (e.g., `BPM/A.csv`) to extract BPM and skin temperature.
- These values are passed to the heatstroke prediction model, making the risk assessment more accurate and personalized.
- The frontend displays these values in both the risk card and a dedicated physiological data card.

## Troubleshooting

### Port Issues
If port 5000/5001/5002 is in use:
- On macOS, disable AirPlay Receiver in System Preferences
- Or modify the port in `arduino_dashboard.py`

### Arduino Connection
- Check if Arduino is properly connected
- Verify the correct port in the code
- Ensure baud rate matches (9600)
